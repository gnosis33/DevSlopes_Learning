                    For today's exploit we'll be going over how to accomplish the fortify restoration loop on PC with console commands. 
                    The 1st step in this process will be acquiring all of the necessary items. 
                    You will need to collect at least 2 items that are enchanted with the enchantment fortified alchemy Which increases the power of potions by a given percentage each time you use the alchemy table. 
                    You will also need at least one piece of jewelry to enchant later on. 
                    For the other items will use the player command: <strong><em>player.additem [item ID] [#ofitems]</em></strong>. 
                    Note that no brackets are needed when typing in the command. 
                    Use the player code <strong>0006BC0B</strong> for Small Antlers and code <strong>00034CDF</strong> for Salt Pile. 
                    Use the player codes <strong>000727DE</strong> and <strong>0006B689</strong> for Blue Butterfly Wing and Hagraven Claw respectively. 
                    OPTIONAL: <em>To make the process faster you can increase your player's skill using the command: 
                    <strong>player.advskill alchemy 999999</strong> To increase alchemy to 100 and add the perks to the 1st item in the perk tree.</em>
                    You also need a Grand Soul Gem Which can be acquired using the code <strong>0002E4FF</strong>.
                    I recommend acquiring at least a 100 of each item so you don't run out at any point.

                <article>
                    1st equip your enchanted items that fortify alchemy and potion making. 
                    Now start the alchemy lab with the button E and blew up a potion of Fortify Restoration using small antlers and salt pile. 
                    Now un-equipped you're enchanted items, Drink the potion of fortify restoration, And re-equip you're enchanted items. 
                    Now brew another potion of Fortify restoration. The percentage on this potion should be higher than the last one. 
                    Repeat the steps By un-equipping your enchanted items drinking the potion potion and re-equipping your items to brew the next potion. 
                    NOTE: <em>The more alchemy enchanted items you have the faster this process will go. 
                    Also the game will have stack overflow errors if you make the potions too high percentage. Ie. 100000%</em> 
                    Repeat this loop until you have a potion with the percentage of your desired strength, And brew a number of these potions. 
                    Now drink one of these potions With your items unequipped one last time. 
                    re-equipping your items and blew up a number of potions of Fortify Enchanting.

                <h2>Phase 3: Enchanting</h2>

                <article>
                    In this phase we'll go over to the Enchanting table. 
                    1st disenchant one item that has the alchemy/potions boost. 
                    This will give you the enchantment for that item. 
                    Now drink one of your potions of fortify enchanting. 
                    Select one of your normal jewelry items Go to the enchantment section and select the alchemy enchantment. 
                    Then select the Grand Soul Gem. At this point you can rename your item. And then finish enchanting it. 
                    Remember you only have 30 seconds to complete this process while the potion is active so work quickly. 
                    If everything was done properly you should now have an equipable item which allows you to brew potions that are extremely strong without doing in the fortify restoration loop. 
                    Now you can use these equipped items to brew up any type of potion you wish and it will be stronger. 
                    One example: <em>brewing up a Fortify Smithing potion. Which will allow you to make your armor much stronger when upgrading armor to legendary.</em>
