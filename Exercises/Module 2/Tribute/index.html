                Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (23 April 1858 - 4 October 1947) was a German theoretical physicist whose discovery of energy quanta won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.

                <p class="quote">“As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, 
                    to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about 
                    the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates 
                    and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an 
                    atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom 
                    together. . . . We must assume behind this force the existence of a 
                    conscious and intelligent Mind. This Mind is the matrix of all matter.”

        <ul>
            <li>Planck came from a traditional, intellectual family. 
                His paternal great-grandfather and grandfather were 
                both theology professors in Göttingen; his father 
                was a law professor at the University of Kiel and 
                Munich. One of his uncles was also a judge
            </li>
            <li>
                In April 1885, the University of Kiel appointed Planck as associate professor of theoretical physics.
            </li>
            <li>
                As a professor at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in Berlin, Planck joined the local Physical Society.
            </li>
            <li>
                In 1894, Planck turned his attention to the problem of black-body radiation.
